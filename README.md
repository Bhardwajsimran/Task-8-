# K-Means Clustering (AI & ML Internship)

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset

**Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset**  
Source: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

---

## ðŸš€ Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Selected key features: `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)`.
3. Scaled the data using `StandardScaler`.
4. Used the **Elbow Method** to identify the optimal number of clusters.
5. Applied K-Means clustering with the chosen K.
6. Visualized the resulting clusters and centroids using a scatter plot.
7. Evaluated the model using **Silhouette Score**.

## ðŸ“Š Results

- **Optimal Number of Clusters:** 5  
- **Silhouette Score:** ~0.55 (value may vary)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

- Understood unsupervised learning and K-Means clustering.
- Practiced data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Implemented Elbow Method and Silhouette Score for model evaluation.
- Visualized clusters and interpreted results.
